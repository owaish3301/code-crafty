# CodeCrafted Learning Platform

A platform that offers roadmaps for different technologies (like Java, React) and helps users track their learning progress and build projects based on what they've learned.

## Features

- **Learning Roadmaps**: Browse and follow structured learning paths for different technologies
- **Progress Tracking**: Log what you've learned and track your progress
- **Project Generation**: AI generates projects based on your learning progress
- **Guided Learning**: Step-by-step guides to help you build projects
- **Feedback System**: Get AI feedback on your code submissions
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage roadmaps, users, and content (for admins only)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
