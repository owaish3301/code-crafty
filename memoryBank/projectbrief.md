# Project Brief

## Platform Overview
A web platform for guided learning using curated roadmaps (e.g., Java, React) managed by the admin. Users log their learning, and AI generates modular project plans based on their progress. Users code module-by-module in a web editor, submit for feedback, and receive AI-driven guidance. Mistakes are tracked for personalized learning.

## MVP Goals
- User authentication and profiles
- Admin-managed roadmap data
- User progress logging per roadmap node
- AI-generated project plans (OpenRouter)
- Simple web code editor (syntax coloring, error display)
- Module submission and feedback loop
- Mistake tracking for adaptive learning

## User Stories
- As a user, I can select a roadmap and log my learning progress.
- As a user, I can generate a project plan based on my progress.
- As a user, I can code each module in a web editor and submit for feedback.
- As a user, I receive actionable feedback and can track my improvement.
- As an admin, I can add/edit roadmaps for all users.
