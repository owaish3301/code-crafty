# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Authentication system: NextAuth.js with GitHub App, PrismaAdapter, JWT sessions, custom session fields, and error handling
- Documenting architecture, tech stack, and user/product context

## Recent Changes
- Implemented robust authentication with GitHub App OAuth and advanced repo/PR scopes
- Integrated PrismaAdapter for persistent user/account/session storage
- Added custom session fields (accessToken, githubId, etc.) and TypeScript types
- Created user-friendly login and error pages
- Updated Memory Bank documentation for authentication

## Open Questions
- None at this stage; authentication system is functional and ready for GitHub API integration

## Next Steps
- Integrate GitHub API for repo creation and PR automation
- Implement role-based access (admin/user)
- Complete Memory Bank with progress.md
- Continue feature development (roadmap, project logging, feedback)
